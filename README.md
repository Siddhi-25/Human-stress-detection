Human Stress Detection and Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This repository contains all the resources and code related to the Human Stress Detection and Prediction project. The project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to analyze physiological data and predict stress levels with high accuracy. It includes the following:

Dataset: A collection of physiological parameters such as heart rate, skin conductance, and more, used for training and testing the model.

Source Code: The complete implementation of the ANN-based stress detection model, including data preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts.

Application Code: Files for the web-based application, including frontend and backend, to input data and display stress predictions.

Presentation: The project presentation detailing the methodology, results, and applications of the system.


Key Features:

Supports real-time stress prediction.

Comprehensive dataset for training and validation.

User-friendly web interface for stress analysis.
